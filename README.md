# EE314-Quality-of-Service-QoS-Based-Queuing
Basically, Quality of Service (QoS)
networks are developed to control the data traffic to optimize the network capacity. In this project,
we have implemented a queuing algorithm using Verilog HDL on FPGAs.

Visualization of QoS system is transferred to the monitor through VGA implementation. 
Priority Queuing and First in & First out implementation is utilized in that system.


QoS project video presentation is provided link below.

Each buffers' weight is designed according to following table.

VGA implementation diagram is designed according to following schematic.

Some Testbench results of the QoS system can be found in the following results.
