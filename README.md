# EE314-Quality-of-Service-QoS-Based-Queuing
Basically, Quality of Service (QoS)
networks are developed to control the data traffic to optimize the network capacity. In this project,
we have implemented a queuing algorithm using Verilog HDL on FPGAs.

Visualization of QoS system is transferred to the monitor through VGA implementation. 

QoS project video presentation is provided link below.
